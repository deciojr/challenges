# Challenges (under construction)

In order to become an employee here at ZRP you need to prove to our team, a select group of extremely competent workers, that you are able to do the tasks that you will assume.

For each area here at ZRP you will have to pass in one challenge. Each area has three levels of challenges, *easy*, *normal* and *hard*. You can choose your destiny and submit the challenge that you think that fits into your profile.

## How to submit

Each area and each level has its own rule to submit the challenge. Read the instructions and send us an email at jobs@zrp.com.br if you have any doubts

## How the process work

### First Phase - The selection

In the first phase you will talk with one of our partners that will evaluate if there is a fit with the company culture. We care for helpful, proactive, communicative and interested in learning people.

### Second Phase - The challenge

If you pass in the first phase you got to choose the challenge that you want to submit and will say to us 
a prediction of how long you will deliver the challenge. You can take your time and submit it wherever you want to. 

Some members of our team will select you if:

- You have a good prediction of the time you need to submit the challenge
- You solved the main problem
- You met the evaluation criteria

### Third Phase - Feedback

For those who have passed in the Second Phase there will be a call in which the members that reviewed your challenge will give a brief feedback saying if you are hired or not and why you are hired or not.

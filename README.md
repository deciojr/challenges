# Challenges (under construction)

In order to become an employee here at ZRP you need to prove to our team, a group of extremely competent people, that you will be able to analyze, predict and perform any given task.

For any given job description, you have three different challenges, an *easy*, a *normal* and a *hard* challenge. You can submit whatever test you think fits your profile.

## How to submit

Each area and each level has it's own rule for submission. Read the following instructions and the challenge instructions.

## How the process work

### First Phase - The selection

In the first phase you will be evaluated by one of our partners. The main goal of this evaluation is to see if there is a fit with the company culture. We care for helpful, proactive, communicative, interested in learning and knowledgeable people.

### Second Phase - The challenge

If you pass the first phase you got to choose the challenge that you want to submit, alongside a prediction of how long will you take to deliver the challenge. There is no time limit for submission.

After your submission our team will decide if you:

- Had a good prediction on the time required to perform the challenge
- Had solved the main problem proposed by the challenge
- Had met our evaluation criteria

### Third Phase - Feedback

For those who have submitted the second phase there will be a review conduct by our team and a brief feedback saying if you are hired or not and why you are hired or not.
